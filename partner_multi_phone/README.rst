Partner Multi Phone
===================
This module adds extra phone fields to make the partner form more alike an android application.

Extra Phone Fields
------------------
Two extra phone fields Home and Other are added.
The Phone field is renamed Work.

Main Phone
----------
The module adds a field `Main Phone`.
This field allows to select which phone type should be prioritised for the partner.
If the field Main Phone is filled, the selected phone type becomes mandatory.

Searching A Partner
-------------------
The module allows to easily find a partner given a phone number.

In the list view of partners, you may enter a fragment of the phone number of your
partner. The system will attempt to match any of the 4 phone fields.

This features works as well with or without the non-digit caracters of the phone number.
Searching 4504623434 should return a partner with the number +1 450-462-3434.
