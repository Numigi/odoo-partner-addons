===========================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
In vanilla Odoo, users with ``Contact Creation`` access are allowed to invite partners to the portal.

This module separates this feature in another user group.
Therefore, a user may grant portal access to the customers without having access to modify the partner records.

Usage
-----
After installing this module, a new group ``Manage Portal Access`` is available.
