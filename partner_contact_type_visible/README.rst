Overview
--------
This module makes the contact type visible on the form view of a partner.

The contact type is also visible if the contact has no parent.

This allows to define the contact as a ``Private Address``.

However, if you select ``Invoice``, ``Shipping`` or ``Other Address``, an error is raised
when saving if the contact has no parent.
