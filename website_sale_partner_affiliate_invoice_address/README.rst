Website Sale Partner Affiliate Invoice Address
==============================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Context
-------
The module, with the module `partner_affiliate_invoicing_address` as dependency, allows to use another invoicing address on ecommerce billing page.

Usage
-----
As an `Azure Montreal` portal user or one of its children like `Mitchel Admin`, I go to the website and see that the billing address used is the billing address defined as the billing address to use.

Notice : in the example, `Coleen Diaz` is used for invoice address, and belongs to `Azure Montreal`.
In the other case, the native restriction for security is applied that it is ``FORBIDDEN``.
