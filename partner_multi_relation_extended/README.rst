Partner relations - Extended
============================
This module extends the relations between partners.

Roadmap
-------
* Add the list of former relations in the parent entity modification wizard in
order to let the user choose which relations should be ended and which ones
should be transferred. Currently, all the former relations are transferred as
they are. But when an employee moves to another company, some of his partner
relations could end at that moment (ex: 'is assistant of').
