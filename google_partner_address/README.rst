Google Partner Address
======================
This module adds assisted address selection using Google Maps.

An autocomplete input is added above the partner address in edit mode.

Filtering with the country and postal code
------------------------------------------
When creating a new contact, you may begin by filling the country and
the beginning of the postal code in the standard form fields.

Then when typing the address in the autocomplete bar, Google will prioritize addresses
that match the country and postal code that you filled.

Configuration
-------------
After installing the module, you must define the google maps api key.

* Go to: Settings -> General Settings
* In the `Google Partner Addresses` section, paste your Google Maps API Key

Generating your API Key
-----------------------
In order to generate an api key, you must setup a project inside your google account.
Then follow Google's documentation on how to setup a Maps Javascript API:
