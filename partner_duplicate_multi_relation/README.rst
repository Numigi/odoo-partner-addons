Partner Duplicate Multi Relation
================================
This module is a binding between partner_duplicate_mgmt and partner_multi_relation.
It defines how relations are propagated from the archived partner to the preserved partner.

Propagation of Relations
------------------------
If the archived partner has a relation and the preserved partner does not have the same relation,
then the relation will be propagated when merging the partners.
