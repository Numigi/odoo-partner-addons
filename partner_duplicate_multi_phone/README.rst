Partner Duplicate Multi Phone
=============================
This module allows to find partner duplicates based on their phone numbers and extensions.

An indexed column is added for each of the 4 phone numbers:

* Work
* Home
* Mobile
* Other

Comparison between phone types
------------------------------
Each type of number is checked against each other.

If a partner has a mobile phone number identical to the work number of another partner,
they will be reported as duplicates.

Comparison of phone extensions
------------------------------
Work and Other phones are indexed with the extension. If 2 contacts have the same
number but with different extensions, they will not be reported as duplicates.

If 2 partners have the same number and extension, they will be reported as duplicates
no matter what their names are.
