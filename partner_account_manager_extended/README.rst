Partner Account Manager Extended
================================
This module adds the account manager field available on some view and options.

Usage
=====
* CONTACTS
As a user with access to the contact, I see that the column in the list view is titled “Manager” :

In “Group by” I am able to quickly group by manager :

And filter in the quick search :

* SALES
Once the Manager is set to the contact, then it will propagate read-only to Sales.
